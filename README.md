# Dummy-Location-Generation
Generating dummy locations using two different agorithms implemented in the MATLAB programming language.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

The following code was written in the MATLAB R2017a programming language.

cells.mat
---------------------------

This mat file contains the data stored within the 4000 by 3 array variable 
'cells'. The information stored within this array is designed to represent the 
local map of the user. The first two columns hold the latitude and longitude 
coordinates of each cell respectively and the third column holds the time spent 
by every user of the GeoLife dataset within each cell.

Dummy Location Generation 1
---------------------------

Bugs: The inbuilt MATLAB function convhull used to determine the privacy
area of the location information generated by the DLG 2 algorithm returns an
error if three or more of the locations are collinear. However, this can be
resolved by running the code again.

- DummyLocationGeneration1.m

The source code of the Dummy Location Generation 1 (DLG 1) algorithm.

This function uses the privacy degree input to determine the value of the 
k-anonymity metric.

The values of the k-anonymity metric assigned to each privacy degree are used
for testing purposes only.

- DLG1script.m

This script calls the DLG 1 algorithm and plots the generated location 
information on a two-dimensional graph.

The range limits if the x axis is the range of the latitude coordinates of the 
simulation area.

The limits of the y axis is the range of the longitude coordinates of the
simulation area.

This script also displays: the running time of the algorithm (the computational
complexity), the area of the generated location information, the entropy of the 
generated location information, and the maximum possible entropy that could be
achieved for the chosen privacy degree input.

- TestDummyLocationGeneration1.m

The source code used to test the Dummy Location Generation 1 (DLG 1) algorithm
for different values of the k-anonymity input.

- DLG1Test.m

was saved within the mat file DLG1Test.mat.

This function determines the query probabilities of the cells within the local 
map using the time spent within each cell by all of the users.

Dummy Location Generation 2
---------------------------

area of the location information generated by the DLG 2 algorithm returns an
error if three or more of the locations are collinear. However, this can be
resolved by running the code again.

The source code of the Dummy Location Generation 2 (DLG 1) algorithm.

This function uses the privacy degree input to determine the value of the

for testing purposes only.

- DLG2script.m

This script calls the DLG 2 algorithm and plots the generated location 
information on a two-dimensional graph.

The range limits if the x axis is the range of the latitude coordinates of the 
simulation area.

The limits of the y axis is the range of the longitude coordinates of the
simulation area.

This script also displays: the running time of the algorithm (the computational

was saved within the mat file DLG2Test.mat.

- probabilityCalculator.m

This function determines the query probabilities of the cells within the local 
map using the time spent within each cell by all of the users.

Random Dummy Generation
---------------------------

Bugs: The inbuilt MATLAB function convhull used to determine the privacy
area of the location information generated by the DLG 2 algorithm returns an
error if three or more of the locations are collinear. However, this can be
resolved by running the code again.

- RandomDummyGeneration.m

The source code of the Random Dummy Generation algorithm.

- RDGscript.m

times for each value of the k-anonymity metric within the range [3,50] 
inclusive.

was saved within the mat file RDGTest.mat.

Phone
---------------------------

- DLG1times.mat

This mat file contains the array variable 'alltimes' which holds the running
times of the DLG 1 algorithm when executed on an iPhone 7 device.

The running time was measured fifty times for each value of the k-anonymity 
metric within the range [3,20] inclusive.

algorithm for each value of the k-anonymity metric on a two-dimensional graph.

Trajectory
---------------------------

Bugs: The scripts within this directory will not run because the GeoLife dataset
was not uploaded with the source code.

- geoTrajectory.m

This script stores the GeoLife GPS trajectories located inside the simulation 
area within the array variable 'positionData'.

- grid.m

This script ensures the time-interval between consecutive time-stamps is no
less than one minute.

The resultant position data is stored within the array variable 'positiontData'.

The (latitude,longitude) coordinates of each time-stamp are then transformed 
into to the (latitude,longitude) coordinates of the centre of the closest cell.

- func.m

This function determines the time spent within the input cell from the input 
position data.

- script.m

This script determines the time spent within each cell by all of the users
within the GeoLife dataset.

# Dummy-Location-Generation
Generating dummy locations using two different agorithms implemented in the MATLAB programming language.

Dummy Location Generation 1 uses the k-anonymity metric and the entropy metric to generate dummy locations within the local map of the user.

Dummy Location Generation 2 generates dummy locations within the local map of the user whilst considering the privacy area of the generated location information.
